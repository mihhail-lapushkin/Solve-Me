# Solve Me ‒ An HTML5 mobile game draft

My first and failed attempt to create a Canvas based HTML mobile game. Later I've rewritten it to [a better version](https://github.com/mihhail-lapushkin/Ancient-Riddle).

PS ‒ Fonts are a bit off, since I had to change the paid font I used during development to a free one (to avoid legal issues when open sourcing).
