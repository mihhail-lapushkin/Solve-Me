### An HTML5 mobile game draft
![screenshot](http://s17.postimage.org/9dzgj9s9r/Screen_Shot_2013_03_07_at_20_23_01.png)

My first and failed attempt to create a Canvas based HTML mobile game. Later it was rewritten to [a better one](https://github.com/mihhail-lapushkin/Ancient-Riddle).

PS â€’ Fonts are a bit off, since I had to change the paid font (on the screenshot) I used during development to a free one (to avoid legal issues when open sourcing).
